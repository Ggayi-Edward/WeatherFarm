üöÄ Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Displays real-time weather conditions and 14-day forecasts using OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.
Crop Recommendations: Suggests crops based on weather forecasts, soil conditions, and seasons.
Farmer Alerts: Sends push notifications and SMS alerts for critical weather conditions like storms, frost, or drought.
Soil Monitoring: (Optional) Integrates IoT sensors for monitoring soil moisture, pH, and temperature.
Historical Data: Provides access to historical weather trends for better planning.
Actionable Advice: Offers farming tips on planting, irrigation, and pest control based on the weather forecast.
Offline Mode: Enables farmers to access downloaded weather forecasts and advice when offline.
Localization: Supports multiple languages with region-specific farming advice.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): For sending push notifications.
Twilio: For sending SMS alerts.

Backend
Node.js: Backend API for processing weather data, managing notifications, and user preferences.
Firestore: NoSQL database for storing user data, weather information, and crop recommendations.
OpenWeatherMap / WeatherAPI: Used for fetching real-time and forecasted weather data.
Twilio API: For sending SMS alerts to farmers for critical weather events.

üì≤ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js (v14 or higher)
Expo CLI (for React Native)
Firebase CLI (for Firebase setup)
Twilio Account (for SMS alerts)
OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI API Key

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-analysis-farmers-mobile.git
cd weatherfarm

Frontend Setup (React Native):

Install the necessary dependencies for the React Native application:

npm install
Backend Setup (Node.js):

If using Node.js:
cd backend
npm install
npm start

Environment Variables:

Set up your environment variables for API keys in a .env file:

OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token

Firebase Setup:

Set up Firebase for authentication, real-time data, and notifications:

Go to the Firebase Console and create a project.
Add Firebase to your mobile app, and download the google-services.json (for Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (for iOS).
Replace the corresponding files in the frontend folder.
üì≤ Features Overview
Push Notifications
The app uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send real-time push notifications for critical weather alerts:

Configure FCM in your Firebase project.
Set up a listener in the mobile app for receiving notifications.
Use the backend to trigger notifications based on weather conditions (e.g., storms, frost).

SMS Alerts
The app uses Twilio to send SMS alerts to farmers for severe weather conditions:

Set up a Twilio account and get your Account SID and Auth Token.
Use the backend to trigger SMS messages based on severe weather conditions.
Farmers can manage their phone number and alert preferences in the app.

üß™ Testing
Run the backend and Expo development server.
Test the push notifications and SMS alert functionality by simulating adverse weather events.
Use Expo to preview the mobile app on Android/iOS devices or emulators.

üöÄ Deployment
Mobile App
